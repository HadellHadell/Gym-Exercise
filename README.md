## Features

### Homepage:
A page with the main content and introductory text which show the user what he or she will find on the site and what the use of the site is for. Display main content and is the center page of the websites information and structure
 
### Gallery page:
A page which holds pictures and video elements from the gym which will work as a tool to give the user a perception of what the gym looks like and give a short feeling on the social atmosphere.
* The gallery page also contains image elements and video elements to give the user a good insight in the main content

* The contact page is also displaying a map from google maps to increase the useability. It displays the gyms location on the map as a complement to the written address

The footer sits at the bottom of all the websites pages and display links and font awesome symbols to social media platforms where the gym is active
 
### Header:
The header contains the logo of the gym "Gym Exercise" and the navigation links mentioned earlier. The logo has the function that when you click it you automatically gets directed to the homepage
 
## future features:
 
### Schedule page for training sessions:
In the future I would like to implement a schedule feature where the user can observe a schedule with training sessions led by the gym staff. The schedule should display which time the sessions are taking place and where in the gym (or perhaps if it is an outdoor session).
 
### Member login:
I would also in the future implement a member page where members log in via the main page and get directed to this new page. On this page I want to show the user features as when the user last visited the gym and for how long that session lasted. I would like to give the user the ability to log and track progress related to their training sessions from the gym so the member page becomes a useful tool.
 
## Typography and color scheme
The fonts and color scheme I have chosen derives from the basic idé that the site is going to look professional, slick and pleasing. This without taking the focus from the content
### Fonts:
I have chosen the fonts Cormorant SC because it looks slick and professional. It gives a sense of clarity and is easily read. Together with the second font i´ve chosen it works perfect they compliment each other really well. The second font is Lora which has a small roundness to the look and isn't as sharp as Cormorant SC and this is a good relationship between them
